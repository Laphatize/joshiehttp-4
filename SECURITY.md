## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability just open a standard issue. I'll take a look at it,
assess its validity, and fix it if I possibly can. If I can't fix it, a note
will be posted on the repository's README.md file for all to see until the bug
is fixed. Disclosure is immediate, since it's just a regular GitHub issue. No
bounties will be awarded, sorry. Thanks will be given though!
